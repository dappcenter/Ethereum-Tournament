# Ethereum-Tournament

DApp to organise an (FIFA-)Tournament on the Ethereum Blockchain. 

A Gamemaster can create tournaments, set fees and commit scores. Players can join tournaments and will recieve ETH if they win.
Tournament system is [Round-Robin (all-play-all)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).

### First Website + first DApp. Be aware of nasty code with no tests.
